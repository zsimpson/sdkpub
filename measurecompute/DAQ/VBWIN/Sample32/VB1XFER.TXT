To create a project in VB1 using text saved in VB2, 3 or 4.

1) Determine which project you wish to create in VB1 and read
   the .MAK file with a text editor to determine which files
   are associated with that project.  There is likely to be
   only two files involved, a .BAS file and a .FRM file.

2) Start VB1 and open a new project.

3) In the project box, select Form1.frm and click on 'View Code'.

4) From the Code menu, select 'Load Text'.

5) In the 'Load Text' dialog box, change the File Name extension
   from '.TXT' to '.FRM'.

6) Select the form file you wish to add to your project (determined
   in step 1) and select 'Replace'.

7) The General Declarations section of Form1 should now appear on
   the screen with a text description of the original form properties.
   Comment out each line from 'VERSION 2.00' down to the last 'End'
   statement.  (These commented lines will be helpful in creating
   objects on the form later.)

8) Click on the 'Proc:' combo box.  You will notice several procedures
   with names like 'cmdStartConvert_Click' or 'tmrCheckStatus_Timer'.
   These procedures are intended to be associated with objects such as
   Buttons and Timers.  The next step is to create these objects with
   the same names as the procedures that exist for them.  For example,
   to create an object for the 'cmdStartConvert_Click' procedure:

   a) click on Form1 to set the focus to Form1
   b) double-click on the Button icon in the Toolbox. (A Button 
      will appear on Form1 labeled 'Command 1')
   c) select the Button (click on it once to set the focus)
   d) click on the properties combo box for the Button and find
      the 'CtlName' property
   e) change it from 'Command1' to 'cmdStartConvert'
   f) check that when you double click the Button, the procedure
      code cmdStartConvert_Click appears on the screen
   g) check the property values listed in the 'general declarations'
      section against the rest of the properties listed in the
      properties combo box

9) Repeat this procedure for all the procedure names listed in the 
   'general declarations' section of Form1 (the lines that were
   commented out at the beginning of this procedure).  Note: Do not
   create objects for stand-alone procedures not associated with 
   events such as Click, Timer, LostFocus, Load, etc.  These are 
   most easily identified from the lack of an underscore in the 
   procedure name and the first three letters of the procedure 
   name do not suggest a control name (cmd, tmr, frm, chk, opt, 
   txt, lbl, pic, hsb, vsb, cmb or fra). These are standard pro-
   cedures that are not associated with events.

10)After all event procedures have an assciated object, build the
   Global module by selecting Global.bas in the Project window and
   clicking 'View Code'.  From the Code menu, click on 'Load Text'.

11)In the 'Load Text' dialog box, change the File Name extension
   from '.TXT' to '.BAS'.  Select 'CBW.BAS' to complete the procedure.

12)If any other forms or modules are required (as determined in
   step 1) create the new form or module and repeat the steps above
   for each form or module.
