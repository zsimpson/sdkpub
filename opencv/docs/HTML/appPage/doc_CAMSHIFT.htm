      Description</H1>
    This application demonstrates a fast, simple color tracking algorithm that
    can be used to track faces, hands etc described in <B><A HREF="CAMSHIFT_doc/camshift.pdf">camshift.pdf</A></B>.
    The CAMSHIFT algorithm is a modification of the Meanshift algorithm which
    is a robust statistical method of finding the mode (top) of a probability
    distribution. Both CAMSHIFT and Meanshift algorithms exist in the library.
    While it is a very fast and simple method of tracking, because CAMSHIFT
    tracks the center and size of the probability distribution of an object,
    it is only as good as the probability distribution that you produce for
    the object. Typically the probability distribution is derived from
    color via a histogram, although it could be produced from correlation,
    recognition scores or bolstered by frame differencing or motion detection
    schemes, or joint probabilities of different colors/motions etc.
    
    <br><br>
    In this application, we use only the most simplistic approach:
    A 1-D Hue histogram is sampled from the object in an HSV color space version
    of the image. To produce the probability image to track, histogram
    "back projection" (we replace image pixels by their histogram hue value)
    is used. The raw video image and backprojection is shown in the following
    image:<br><br>

    <CENTER><B>Figure 1</B></CENTER>
    
    <br>
    Since we use such a simple method in this application, you must tune
    the parameters for your camera and the lighting in the image as described
    below.
    <BR><BR>
    Note that this filter requires that you have DirectShow 6.0 or greater installed.
    DirectShow 6.0 for NT4.0, DirectShow 7.0 for Win 98 or Win2000). 
    You will also need a video camera source filter which should
    be supplied by your USB camera vendor. <!-- except most don't support NT4.0. -->
<!-- %%Some friendly advice from Uncle Gary?? -->
<!--    Win2000 is your best bet for development, for just running the filter graph, Win98 will do.. An example filter graph is shown below (with the calibration filter processing a video source from a Matrox Meteor II card that we wrote ourselves) and then passing the output to a video renderer. -->

    Microsoft* Windows* 2000 may be the most suitable operating system
    for development since many vendors do not supply filters for
    Windows NT 4.0. However, Windows 98 will be adequate for just
    running the filter graph.&nbsp;

      How to</H2>
    <h3>Track a colored object (face, ball etc):</h3>
    (<B>a</B>) Reset thresholds: Set Threshold [5] to zero; Saturation
    [7] far left; Minimum brightness [8] far left; Maximum brightness [9] far
    right.
    <BR>(<B>b</B>) Click video [1], bouncing ball [2] or AVI [3] to select
    your input source.
    <BR>(<B>c</B>) Check the raw video display [10] button.
    <BR>(<B>d</B>) Set the number of bins [6] you want in your histogram (32-100
    is a good number).
    <BR>(<B>e</B>) Use your mouse to draw a sample box over the colored object
    that you want to track.
    <h3>...Tuning...</h3>
    (<B>f</B>) Check the histogram "Back Project" [10] button. You
    want the object to be well segmented as in figure 1 above. To get
    things well segmented, adjust things in the order described below:
    <BR>(<B>g</B>) Increase (move the slider to the right) the mimimum acceptable
    saturation threshold [7]. Make sure you allow a little time to see
    how your adjustment is working. Often moving it about 25% of the way to
    the right is sufficient.
    <BR>(<B>h</B>) If (g) doesn't do the whole job, then increase the minimum
    acceptable brightness threshold [8] to the right allowing enough time to
    see the effect at each position. Usually 20-50% of the way to the right
    works.
    <h3>...not working...</h3>
    (<B>i</B>) If (g) &amp; (h) do not give you a well segmented object,
    you probably need to change your camera settings and/or lighting.
    Histogram threshold [5] can have a marginal effect on edge regions.
    Decreasing (move to the left) high brightness threshold [9] can diminish
    edges and glaring white regions in the video image, usually moving it no
    more than 10% of the way to the left. Setting more histogram bins
    [6] sometimes helps.
