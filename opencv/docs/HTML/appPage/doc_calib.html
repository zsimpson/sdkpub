      Description
    </H1>
    The camera calibration tool lets you calibrate any video camera very accurately
    and in few seconds.
    
    <br><br>
      The user presents a flat checkerboard pattern in front of the camera,
      and the program automatically acquires a number of images and uses them
      to compute the intrinsic camera parameters (focal length, principal point,
      distortion coefficients) as well as the extrinsic parameters (3D position
      of the pattern for each image).
    <br><br>
    Since the corners of the pattern are located automatically on each image,
      the entire procedure is fully automatic. Once calibration is done, the
      program lets you undistort the video images in real time (at frame rate).
      The lens distortion model consists of two terms: a radial distortion term
      (up to the fourth order) and a tangential distortion term (two scalars
      for encoding the angular orientation of the focal plane with respect to
      the sensor plane). Consequently, the lens distortion model is parameterized
      using four scalar coefficients.
<br><Br>
    A complete tutorial of the algorithm with matlab code is provided, see
      <A HREF="#Tutorial">Tuturial Section below</A>.

      DirectShow Filter Application
    </H2>
    Note that this filter requires that you have DirectShow 6.0 or greater installed
    with <B>graphedt.exe&nbsp; </B>(DirectShow 6.0 for NT4.0, DirectShow 7.0 for
    Win 98 or Win2000) 
    (<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=16927">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=16927</A> ~128MB[!]). 
    You will also need a video camera source filter which should
    be supplied by your USB camera vendor. <!-- except most don't support NT4.0. -->
<!-- %%Some friendly advice from Uncle Gary?? -->
<!--    Win2000 is your best bet for development, for just running the filter graph, Win98 will do.. An example filter graph is shown below (with the calibration filter processing a video source from a Matrox Meteor II card that we wrote ourselves) and then passing the output to a video renderer. -->

    Microsoft* Windows* 2000 may be the most suitable operating system
    for development since many vendors do not supply filters for
    Windows NT 4.0. However, Windows 98 will be adequate for just
    running the filter graph
    <br><br>
    An example filter graph is shown below. It is running our own
    calibration filter that processes a video source from a Matrox
    Meteor II card and then passes the output to a video renderer.

      How To...
    </H2>
    
    <h3>
      Calibrate a camera
    </h3>

    <B>(a)</B> Get or make a black and white checkerboard calibration object
    as shown in the images above or animated gif's below.
    <BR><B>(b)</B> Enter the number of columns ("squares per row") in [1] and
    number of rows (squares per column) in [2]; Enter the size of a square
    <!-- %%Whatever units? -->
    in whatever units in [3] (optional) ; Enter the number of frames that you
    want to collect in [9] (10-20 usually suffices); Enter the minimum time
    between capturing frames to allow you time to move the calibration object.
    <BR><B>(c)</B> Click "Apply" [12].
    <BR><B>(d)</B> Click "Start" [4].
    <BR><B>(e)</B> Move the checkerboard around. The number of frames
    collected will display in [11]. When all frames are collected it will solve
    for the calibration parameters and display them in [11].
    <BR><B>(f)</B> Checking [7] followed by clicking "Apply" [12] causes the
    rectified video image to be displayed as shown in the second example below.
    
    <br><br>Notes: When calibrating, the video image flashes when a frame is captured.
      It won't capture unless the colored lines are drawn on the checkerboard
      as shown in the examples below. You must move the calibration object
      around -- if your views are too much alike, you will get an ill-conditioned
      matrix with resultant divide by zero when the filter solves for the camera
      calibration parameters.
      
    <h3>
      Save calibration parameters to a file:
    </h3>
    <B>(a) </B>Click "Save" [5] and a dialog box will prompt you for
    saving the calibration parameters under a text file. Click this
    <a href="cam_model.html">link</a> for information on the camera model, and the content of the text file.
      
    <h3>
      Load previously stored calibration parameters:
    </h3>
    <B>(a)</B> Click "Load" [6] and a dialog box will allow you to select
    a calibration parameter file.
    <BR><B>(b)</B> Calibration parameters will appear in [11].
      
    <h3>
      Turn image rectification on and off:
    </h3>
    <B>(a)</B> On: Check the "Undistortion" box [7]. Click "Apply" [12].
    <BR><B>(b)</B> Off: Un-check the "Undistortion" box [7]. Click "Apply"
    [12].
      
    <h3>
      Turn the 3D OpenGL window on and off:
    </h3>
    <B>(a)</B> On: Check the "Show 3D window" box [8]. Click "Apply" [12].
    <BR><B>(b)</B> Off: Un-check the "Show 3D window" box [8]. Click
    "Apply" [12].
