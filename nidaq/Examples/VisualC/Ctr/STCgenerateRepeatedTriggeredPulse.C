/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    STCgenerateRepeatedTriggeredPulse.c
*
* Description: 
*    Repeatedly generates a digtal pulse 1 ms LOW and 100 ms HIGH using
*     general purpose counter 0 upon every trigger.  This is different
*     from CSTC1tPl in that you don't have to rearm after each trigger.
*     (for devices with the DAQ-STC counter/timer)
*
* Example Category: 
*    CTR
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    PLSTRN, 1PT
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    ulGpctrNum, ulGpctrOutput, ulLOWcount, ulHIGHcount
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    GPCTR_Control, NIDAQErrorHandler, GPCTR_Set_Application,
*     GPCTR_Change_Parameter, Select_Signal, NIDAQWaitForKey
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Your digital pulses will be on the OUT pin of your counter.
*     Connect your digital trigger pulse to the GATE pin of your
*     counter Connect the ground reference to the DIG GND pin.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
