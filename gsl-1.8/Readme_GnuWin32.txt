GSL - GNU Scientific Library
============================

This is GSL, the GNU Scientific Library, a collection of numerical
routines for scientific computing.  See README for more information.

GSL is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License (see COPYING).

The GNU General Public License does not permit this software to be
redistributed in proprietary programs.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

GSL 1.8 for Windows
===================

This distribution of GSL was generated from a slightly modified
gsl 1.8 source (see ChangeLog for more information on changes).
The static and dynamic libraries were compiled using gcc 3.4.2 (MinGW).
gcc import libraries for libgsl.dll and libgslcblas.dll are provided in
the lib subdirectory.  Tools supplied with other compilers should be
able to generate import libraries from the dll's if necessary.
Significantly, newer versions of gcc (Cygwin & MinGW) support direct
linking of dll's without the need for an import library.

The libraries were compiled for release.  All modules were optimized at
gcc -O3 (except -O0 for monte/vegas.c, since any optimization by gcc/mingw
3.4.2 resulted in precision errors on testing).  To compile debug versions,
link in a different cblas, or otherwise modify the libraries, the
source code is available from:
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617.

gcc debug and MSVC versions of the libraries are also available from the
author of this port <jds2@users.sourceforge.net>.

Installation & Use
==================

GSL is primarily a library resource for numerical programming.  Place
the libraries and headers in a convenient location, and point your
compiler and linker there.

If you wish to use the dll version of GSL, note the following:

  - Define the macro GSL_DLL when compiling.  This will flag the
    public API functions & variables with __declspec(dllimport).

  - The libgsl.dll and libgslcblas.dll libraries must be located
    in the standard dll search path.  This is usually either in
    the same location as your executable, or in \windows\system32.

Building GSL
============

GSL may be built using MinGW and ftjam.
See .\jam\Readme_jam.txt for more information on this build option.

GSL may also be built using VC8.
See .\VC8\Readme_VC8.htm for more information on this build option.
