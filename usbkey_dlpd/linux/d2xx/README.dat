Instructions for installing the d2xx shared lib
As Linux distributions vary these instructions are a guide to installation and use.
This setup works with Mandrake 9.2 but may require some investigation on other distributions.

This library has been tested using kernel 2.4.25. 

D2XX documentation is available for the Windows dll - some variations may occur between linux and 
windows implementation. We have endevoured to make the APIs appear the same on both platforms however some
issues may slip and we would appreciate that you contact support if you observe this.

D2XX for linux was primarily developed to aid porting windows applications written with D2XX to linux.
Unfortunately the source code for D2XX is not freely available - however if you prefer to have the 
source and are starting a project from scratch you can try libftdi from Thomas Jarosch. 
Details of this library are on the ftdi web site. 

Installation:
1. unzip and untar the file given to a suitable directory
gunzip libftd2xx0.4.12.tar.gz
tar -xvf libftd2xx0.4.12.tar

2. As root user copy the following files to /usr/local/lib
cp libftd2xx.so.0.4.12 /usr/local/lib

3. Change directory to /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/local/lib

4. make symbolic links to these files using the following commands:
ln -s libftd2xx.so.0.4.12 libftd2xx.so

5. Change directory to /usr/lib
cd /usr/lib

6. make symbolic links to these files using the following commands:
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libftd2xx.so.0.4.12 libftd2xx.so

7. Add the following line to /etc/fstab:
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs defaults,devmode=0666 0 0
There have been reports that you may need to use the following command for some distros
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs defaults,mode=0666 0 0 (use usbfs in 2.6 kernels)

8. Remount all in the fstab file
mount -a

If you have problems with this check with usbview (search on the internet for application 
or it can be sent to you by ftdi) to check the usb file system is mounted properly.

Other problems will be related to the ftdi_sio driver loading - 
1.you must unload this driver (and usbserial) if it is attached to your device ("rmmod ftdi_sio" and "rmmod usbserial"as root user). 
2.Your PID/VID has not been included in the distribution.A PID of 0x6006 and VID of
0x0403 should work as a temporary workaround.

Release 0.4.13
Software flow control fix (strip out flow control characters)
Added FT_SetDeadmanTimeout API call

Release 0.4.12
Configuration file (see Config.txt for further details) option added to omit a usb reset
on device open.

Release 0.4.11
FT_SetUSBParameters fix - checks for invalid parameters
New driver version functions added.
Altered behaviour of a usb reset - only performed on unopened device (2.6 kernels only)
Improved multithreaded access around listdevices and open functions.

Release 0.4.10
W32 functions and samples added (for the extra event handling)
232R EEPROM support added.
Some minor bug fixes regarding FT_OpenEx.
More robust checking of passed in arguments. Will fail on an invalid handle and NULL pointers instead
of causing Segmentation Faults.

Release 0.4.9
Additional OpenEx bug fix - please report any future bugs as alternate dirstibutions 
may behave in a different manner.
100% CPU count fix when using FT_SetBitMode and not using FT_Read to clear internal buffers.

Release 0.4.8
Open bug fix - related to the detach of ftdi_sio kernel driver.

Release 0.4.7
Read timeout bug fix.

Release 0.4.6 (known as 0.4.6 on the web)
Bug fix to allow user area of 2232 chip to be programmed.

Release 0.4.5 (known as 0.4.5 on the web)
Small change to allow detach of ftdi_sio kernel driver on device access.

Release 0.4.4 (known as 0.4.4 on the web)
Added FT_CreateDeviceInfoList, FT_GetDeviceInfoList, FT_GetDeviceInfoDetail, FT_EE_ReadEx and
FT_EE_ProgramEx.

Release 0.4.3 (known as 0.4.3 on the web)
Bug fix for 2.6 kernels with bulk writes - library now requres "/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease" file to be present in system

Release 0.4.2 (known as 0.4.2 on the web)
Bug fix for the lib_table functionality. Now works with both static and dynamic 
library versions.

Release 0.4.1 (known as 1.1.0.1 on the web)
Minor bug fix relating to modem event notification

Release 0.4.0 (known as 1.1.0.0 on the web)
User space driver compiled with gcc version 3.3.1
Major restructure of internals - it is now a pure c library so no c++ extensions required. 
Should help with some c++ linkage problems. Upped version to 0.4.0 for this reason. PLEASE NOTE
due to the conversion from c++ to c there is an unlikely chance you will experience problems.
If you do a recompile of your application may solve this. If not please contact support. Users of the
PenScope and Dualscope so will experience problems related to this. Please contact support for a suitable update.
FT_GetBitMode Bug Fix
FT_Read on a timeout Bug Fix
FT_GetStatus Bug fix
static library available (see static folder on how to compile)
static linkage to libusb to avoid installation issues

Release 0.3.0 (known as 1.0.0.0 on the web)
Timeouts added.
EEPROM reading/writitng.
Event handling added (see example on how to use)
More examples to help with development
FT_SetVIDPID added - to allow setting of VID and PID - see example


Known issues:

2.6 kernels require a usb reset to be performed prior to opening a device 
otherewise subsequent opens will not be successfull.
This can cause a break (if there is a mixture of opened and unopened devices in 
the system) in communication with any other opened device.
FT_Listdevices and FT_CreateDeviceInfoList will also have this effect.
