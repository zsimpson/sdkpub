file must be called ftd2xx.cfg. An example is provided in the library package.

Sections

[Global] - settings within this section apply to all devices.

[VID_0403&PID_6001] - settings apply to devices of this VID and PID - note this does
NOT replace the FT_SetVIDPID or config table features for adding additional VIDs 
and PIDS - you must still add these for custom VIDs and PIDs

[SerialNumber] - SerialNumber is the unique serial number for a specific device -
this will only apply the settings to individual devices.

ConfigFlags=0x80000000 - this will supress the reset occuring on every open on 2.6
kernel trees - related to incorrect data toggle. 
Some systems a usb reset is required between an open/close pair to allow
furhter open/close pairs. The reset has the effect of breaking communication
in currently open devices. It can also toggle some of the modem control lines which 
can disturb some user hardware. Use this setting if you require to remidy the above
behaviour. However note there may be issues when opening/closing devices in a 2.6 tree.
